## Usage

### CLI

**Install**

First install [generate][] and this module either globally or locally:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate generate-cname
```

**Generate a CNAME file on demand**

The following command will prompt you for the URL to use, then will write a `CNAME` file to the cwd or specified `--dest`:

```sh
$ gen cname 
$ gen cname --dest ./foo
```

### Use as a plugin

You can add a `cname` task to your [generate][] generator by adding the following line in `generator.js`:

```js
app.use(require('generate-cname'));
```

**Example**

Given you have a generator named `generate-foo`, you would run the following to generate a `cname` file:

```sh
$ gen foo:cname
```

You can also run the `cname` task from any other task in your generator, so that a cname file is automatically generated along with other files.
