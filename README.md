> Generate the CNAME file for a web project. Is this necessary? No, not at all. A CNAME file is one line and takes a couple seconds to create. The point of this generator is to automate the creation of the CNAME file based on configuration settings, as a small part of a larger build.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save generate-cname
```

## Usage

### CLI

**Install**

First install [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) and this module either globally or locally:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate generate-cname
```

**Generate a CNAME file on demand**

The following command will prompt you for the URL to use, then will write a `CNAME` file to the cwd or specified `--dest`:

```sh
$ gen cname 
$ gen cname --dest ./foo
```

### Use as a plugin

You can add a `cname` task to your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator by adding the following line in `generator.js`:

```js
app.use(require('generate-cname'));
```

**Example**

Given you have a generator named `generate-foo`, you would run the following to generate a `cname` file:

```sh
$ gen foo:cname
```

You can also run the `cname` task from any other task in your generator, so that a cname file is automatically generated along with other files.
